# iNotes Project

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an application that allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete notes. We are following an Agile approach using the SCRUM framework to manage our development process effectively. Throughout the project, we will document our progress and stages using GitHub Issues instead of JIRA.
